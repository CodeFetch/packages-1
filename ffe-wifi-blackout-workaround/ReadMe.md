ffe-wifi-blackout-workaround
=============================

This is a fork of ffho-wifi-blackout-workaround ([Freifunk Hochstift](https://github.com/FreifunkHochstift/ffho-packages)).


In order to avoid further WiFi-Blackouts that *might* be caused by a buggy ANI
feature in the ath9k kernel module, we disable ANI until it got fixed in
OpenWRT completely.
